Wikis hosted with the MediaWiki software create subpages by adding a slash ("/") after the 'parent' page name. Subpages are used in Wikiversity, where the structure permits contributions by students at any academic level,[2][3] and in both Wikibooks and Wikisource, where chapters are subpages of a book.[4]x
